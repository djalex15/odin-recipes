        <p class="p-home"> James Trevor Oliver (born 27 May 1975) is a British chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author.
            <br> He is known for his casual approach to cuisine, which has led him to front numerous television shows and
            open many restaurants. <br> Oliver reached the public eye when his series The Naked Chef premiered in 1999.
            In 2005, he opened a campaign, Feed Me Better, <br> to introduce schoolchildren to healthier foods, which was
            later backed by the government. He was the owner of a restaurant chain, <br> Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group,
            which opened its first restaurant, Jamie's Italian, in Oxford in 2008. The chain went into administration in May 2019.
