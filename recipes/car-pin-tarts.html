        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>“To round off this 3 course <em>veggie</em> meal, we got a
                special pineapple dessert. It might seem tricky, but trust us,
                it's well worth it!"</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons caster sugar</li>
                <li>1 x 435 g tin of pineapple rings in juice</li>
                <li>20 g desiccated coconut , plus extra for sprinkling</li>
                <li>30 g ground almonds</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste</li>
                <li>60 ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
                <li>3 sheets of filo pastry</li>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>1 whole nutmeg , for grating</li>
                <li>6 quality jarred cherries in syrup</li>
                <li>coconut yoghurt or vanilla ice cream, to serve</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p><strong>ON THE DAY:</strong> Sprinkle the sugar into a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat,
            then add the juice from the pineapple tin, along with a splash of water. Let it simmer until bubbling and
            the sugar has dissolved, then carefully place six pineapple rings into the pan. Cook until the syrup
            has reduced and the pineapple is lightly golden on each side, turning halfway and gently swirling them
            in the syrup occasionally, then turn the heat off and leave to cool completely.</p>

        <p> Meanwhile, whisk the coconut, almonds, vanilla paste and milk together. Lay out one filo sheet,
            brush with a little olive oil and add a few scrapings of nutmeg, then repeat, stacking up all
            three sheets. Cut into six squares, then divide the sponge batter between them, spooning it into
            the centre of each and spreading it out a little. Top each with a sticky pineapple ring, gently
            pressing them into the batter. Casually fold the filo upwards around the pineapple (like you see
            in the picture), lining the tartlets up on a lightly oiled baking tray as you go. Sprinkle with a
            little extra desiccated coconut, then spoon over any remaining syrup from the pan. Cover, and
            refrigerate till needed.</p>

        <p><strong>TO SERVE:</strong> Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F. Bake the tartlets on the bottom of
            the oven for 20 minutes exactly. Serve with a cherry in the centre of each and a drizzle of
            cherry syrup. Finish with a dollop of yoghurt or a scoop of ice cream.</p>
